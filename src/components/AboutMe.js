      <p>
        I'm an Undergraduate student in
        my Senior year studying
        Information Technology at
        Missouri State University. I
        will be graduating Spring of
        2021 with a Bachelor's degree in
        Information Technology and an
        emphasis in Application
        Development.

          More About Me
        </summary>

        <p>
          With my free time,&nbsp; I
          like to cook as well as
          explore local restaurants,
          complete puzzles, and stay
          active by playing pick up
          basketball.&nbsp;
        </p>

        <p>
          After I graduate, I aim to
          work with other individuals
          who are passionate about using
          modern technology and great
          design to deliver incredible
          experiences and products to
          people in a way that is
          environmentally conscious,
          socially inclusive, and
          accessible to all. Until then,
          I will be having fun with
          code, exploring my creativity,
          and trying to find the best
          slice of pizza in town.

          technology I would like to
          learn is a backend technology
