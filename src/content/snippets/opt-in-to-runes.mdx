To opt-in on a project wide level add the following to your svelte.config.js

```ts
  compilerOptions: {
    runes: true,
  }
```

To opt-in on a per-component basis add the following tag to any component

```tsx
<svelte:options runes={true} /> 
```




To opt-out on a per-component basis add the following tag to any component

```tsx
<svelte:options runes={false} /> 
```
