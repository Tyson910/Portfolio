I’m currently using a third party service to handle my contact me form on my [personal site](https://tyson-suttle.vercel.app/contact). This was fine when I initially created my site because I just wanted a simple contact form up and running as quickly as possible, but now I’m ready to try out making my own form handling solution due to limitations that come with SaaS free tiers. Ideally my form handler will be able to work for not only my own personal site, but also any sites that clients may want in the future. In this series I’m going to write out my planning process, the pros/cons to each solution, and any debugging :bug: I’ll need to do.

Before choosing tech stack, deployment options, or anything else I’ll first need to tackle the core problems I aim to solve when I create this software. In a nutshell this form handling software will need to be able to:

1. [ ] Receive & handle a post request
2. [ ] Validate the form data to make sure all required fields are present & formatted in a way I can use
3. [ ] Send an email to containing all information from the form to the website owner
4. [ ] Send a success page to the user to let them know the email sent
5. [ ] Ideally this software is flexible enough to be used for any client website I might build in the future.

These 5 core problems/steps will be my “North Star” during every part of this process. I plan to update this initial post with each subsequent post as I create them.
